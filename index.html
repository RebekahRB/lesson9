        Straight to the Point Archery is where you can start! My name is Giap Nguyen and I started Straight to the Point Archery
        in 2005. I'm an avid and accomplished archer having competed with the United States Archery Team in the 2000 Summer Olympics.
        I started Straight to the Point in part because I was not satisfied with
        the archery eduction options for young people in Tacoma. After The Hunger Games books and movies came out,
        I noticed a surge in the popularity of archery among young people, especially young women. I founded Straigh to the Point because
        I wanted to provide a quality environment for learning this fun sport.
